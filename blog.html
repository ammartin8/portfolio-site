          <p class="blog-post-meta">July 21st, 2019 by <a href="contact.html">Amah</a></p>
          <p class="lead my-3">Last year, I was absolutely ecstatic to getting my first real camera. However, 
              I was a bit overwhelmed by the numerous buttons and settings and I wasn’t really that confident on how to use it. </p>

                <h3>1.	Learn Your Camera</h3>
                <p>I know it’s tempting to just go out and start snapping photos but if you’re not at least familiar with the basic settings of your camera, how will you know how to take good pictures? What really helped me the most was reading the instruction guide that came with the camera and watching YouTube videos detailing how to use the settings for your specific camera really gave me a basic foundation. Also, it helps to know how to make adjustments when you need it ahead a time rather than in the moment.</p>
                
                <h3>2.	Learn to Shoot in Manual Mode</h3>
                <p>Everyone is a photographer until…you need to shoot in <em>Manual Mode</em>. Now I hope you didn’t buy your fancy new camera just to shoot in auto mode did you? Otherwise, you are missing out on taking advantage of the real power of using your camera. Shooting in Manual Mode is a <strong>MUST HAVE</strong> skill in photography. You need to understand how to adjust your ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed in order to capture perfect photos in every setting.</p>
                
                <h3>3.	Shoot in RAW Format</h3>
                <p>Taking photos in RAW format photos allows you the freedom to make more adjustments in photo processing compared to shooting in just JPEG. After I learned this bit information, I’ve always taken my photos in RAW ever since. Do you know the difference between shooting RAW vs JPEG? Read <a href="#"><em>What is RAW Format and Why should I care?</em></a></p>

                <h3>4.	Use Photo Processor To Make Your Photos Stand Out</h3>
                <p>It’s pretty common practice for photographers to use a photo processor to make minor adjustments and edits to their photos. Currently, my main go to for photo processing is Adobe Lightroom. I really like the ability to batch process photos from your camera quickly and it keeps a nice way to keep your catalog of photos in an orderly fashion. Adobe Photoshop is another popular option that has more tools that can be used to pretty much do anything you can imagine with when editing photos. Some photographers use both software in their photography work flow as well. If you not a fan of paying a monthly subscription, you may want to check out Affinity Photos, for a one-time fee you have access to use their software as much as you want. Although I haven’t used them yet, the reviews I have seen makes Affinity Photos seem like a good alternative to Adobe Photoshop. There are also a number of free software photo processor tools such as GIMP and Inkscape as well.</p>
