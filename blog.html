            <h1>Understanding Flexbox: The Difference Between Space-Between and Space-Around</h1>

            <p>
                Recently I have practicing my skills in flexbox using www.flexboxfroggy.com (fun little game that
                challenges you to move the frog to the lilly pad using flexbox). The reason I wanted to learn the basic
                concepts of flexbox in the beginning of my coding journey because it has a growing standard to make
                website responsive regardless of the type of device used to view any website. The CSS flexbox Layout is
                a great model to use to achieve responsive websites. It has also been included in the World Wide Web
                Consortium's (W3C) candidate recommendation stage which sets standards for the world wide web.

            <p>
                The main idea of flexbox is to define elements in terms of two axes which are referred to as the main
                axis and
                the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex direction property and the cross axis runs
                perpendicular to the main axis. The cross axis can be set using the <code>row</code>,
                <code>row-reverse</code>, <code>column</code>, or
                <code>column-reverse</code> property. You can learn more about the flexbox model on the (Mozilla
                Developer Network)
                Website by reviewing (Basic concepts of flexbox).

                While practicing my flexbox skills using flexfroggy, I realized I was having trouble differeiating
                between <code>space-between</code> and <code>space-around</code> values in justify-content property. I
                was also struggling
                with figuring out when it is appropriate to use <code>justify-content</code>,
                <code>align-content</code>, <code>align items</code>. I
                realized this because I started to just test out each property until I got the right answer, so I
                decided to write this mini post on the concept and help me further cement the concept in my mind. If you
                have trouble with understanding the differences as well here is a summary of what I learned:
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Using Justify-content: Space-around vs. Space-between</h2>

            <p>
                When you need to the justify-content property, comparing space-around vs space-between the difference
                appears subtle at first, depending on how much space you have in your flexbox container. The value
                <code>space-between</code> evenly distributes space "between" each item equally in the flexbox container
                where the
                first item is on the start of the line and the last item is on the end of the line:
            </p>

            [Insert image showing space between]
            <br>

            <p>
                The value <code>space-around</code> also distributes items evenly however, the the space is distributed
                "around"
                each item equally within the flexbox container. Visually this may look uneven, especially when looking
                at the first and last items but this because the space is applied on top, bottom, left and right of
                "every" item and since there are no items on either end, it will only apply a half-size space compared
                to the other items:

            <h2>What's the Difference? Justify-content vs Align-content vs Align-item</h2>

            <p>
                I don't know about you but when I not sure what of the answer when coding, I start guessing what should
                go there until I get the outcome I want and if don't get the right outcome, I do a google search. This
                method is perfectly fine, it certainly is part of learning to code but as I said, I realize this is a
                concept I still struggle with because I tend to focus on whether or not it works instead of "why" it
                works. And who knows, it might pop up as an interview question someday. So here we go:
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Justify-content</h2>

            <p>
                The justify-content property is used to align the items in flexbox container on the main axis. Remember
                that the main axis is determined by the <code>flex-direction</code> so if the direction is defined as a
                column for
                example, then the justify-content property will align items along the column and if it is defined as a
                row, items will align along the row, etc. The justify-content property is useful for basically aligning
                the items in the flexbox container and helps distributes space left over in the container.
            </p>

            <br>
            [Insert example]
            <br>

            <h2>Align-content</h2>

            <p>
                I often get this confused with justify-content and wonder why my items or containers are not adjusting
                as I expect. The align-content property is useful for aligning the "lines" within the flex container
                when there
                is extra space within the container along the cross axis. So if you want the content within the
                container to be at the top you would provide the <code>flex-start</code> value, which is default. If you
                prefer to
                have the content in the middle of the container you would provide the center value. Keep in mind that if
                there is only one line of items in the container you will not see any changes by adjusting the align
                content property.
            </p>
            <br>
            [Insert example]
            <br>

            <h2>Align-items</h2>

            <p>
                The <code>align-items</code> property is useful for adjusting how the items within the container will be
                aligned
                along the cross axis. In contrast, justify-content adjust the items along the main axis.
